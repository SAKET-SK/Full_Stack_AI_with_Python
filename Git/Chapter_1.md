## Chapter 1: Introduction to Git

Git = Version Control. 

It is like a checkpoint in a video game, where you store the progress. If anything goes wrong, you may restart it from there.

### What problem does Git solve?

Before Git, teams faced 3 massive problems:

<b>Problem 1: No history you can trust</b>

Files were saved as:

```
final.doc
final_v2.doc
final_v3_REAL_FINAL.doc
```

No way to know, Who changed what, When and Why

<b>Problem 2: Collaboration chaos</b>

Two developers editing the same file → overwrites

There was No conflict detection Nor accountability

<b>Problem 3: Central point of failure</b>

Older systems (like SVN):

One central server, if goes Server down = work stops; No offline work

Git was created to solve all three, permanently.
