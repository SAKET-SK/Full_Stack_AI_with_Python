Docker engine is necessary to run docker. All container related management is done by this docker engine.

The Docker CLI communicates with the Docker daemon to manage:
- Images
- Containers
- Networks
- Volumes

If you write:
docker run -it ubuntu -> run indicates that run the docker engine

Type "docker" to obtain list of all commands you can run. (Refer the Docker_Commands.txt file)

Some commands:
docker ps -> lists only "running" containers
docker ps -a -> lists "all" containers even if they are in exit state

ps is a shorthand. You may type "docker ps --help"

docker images   -> Gets all images on your machine

There is always a docker socket (Docker Daemon) who listens to all our commands and gives us output.

What this command does : docker run -it ubuntu
- Image lookup (local or remote)
- Container creation
- Filesystem assembly
- Namespace assignment
 -cgroup application
- Default command execution (/bin/bash for Ubuntu)
- Terminal attachment (due to -it)

Meaning of Flags:
-i: Keeps STDIN open
-t: Allocates a pseudo-terminal (TTY)

Without -it, containers that rely on interactive shells exit immediately.

For image name, first it checks whether I have a local copy of it. If yes, then it runs. If not, then it pulls it from internet.
All the images can be found at Docker Hub. (hub.docker.com)

docker pull <image-name>  -> pulls the image (doesn't run immidiately)

docker image inspect <image-name>   -> Inspects the image, the name of image u specify should be on your machine. Gives all info in the form of metadata.

docker image pull <image-name> -> pulls the image.
docker iamges   -> lists all images
docker image prune  -> removes dangling images i.e. removes unused images

For more commands run : docker image --help

Working with containers:

docker container rm <container-id>  -> Removes the container
The container id is visible at the start, when you type commands.

docker run -it ubuntu -> Creates a container with random name.
docker run -it --name <my-container-name> ubuntu   -> Here you can specify the name

docker kill <container-id>   -> Terminate the container

Difference between Killing and Removing
Killing is just switching off your machine. It is still out there. Removing means deleting its existence overall.

docker container rm <container-id>
docker container rm <container-1-id> <container-2-id> ... <container-n-id>
docker container rm --help

Every "image" has an entry point. For example, defualt entry point for ubuntu is "bash".
To get to know about entry point, input : "docker image inspect ubuntu"
Scroll down and find:

"cmd":[
    "/bin/bash"
],...

docker run -it ubuntu ls  -> runs ls commands and exits
If the ls is not given here, it will go to the entry point.

docker run busybox ping google.com  -> The container remains running as long as its main process is active.

In this chapter, we explored practical container and image management.
You learned:
- How to run, name, inspect, stop, kill, and delete containers
- How to pull, inspect, prune, and remove images
- The roles of ENTRYPOINT and CMD
- Why interactive mode (-it) is required for shell-based images

These fundamentals enable smooth container lifecycle management and prepare the foundation for advanced topics such as Dockerfiles, 
networking, volumes, and orchestration.
